Horizontal gravel pack calculation of alpha wave height and minimum transport slurry rate.

This uses a model that can be modified to accept various assembly dimensions and slurry properties to calculate the
velocity of the slurry in the channel above the alpha wave sand bed.  The code uses the calculation of velocity
to vary the solids concentration in the slurry, until the flowing pressure gradients in the wash pipe by screen annulus is
the same as pressure gradient in the channel above the sand bed.

The primary feature of this calculation is that it can estimate the minimum surface slurry rate that can transport gravel
pack sand along the open hole horizontal.
